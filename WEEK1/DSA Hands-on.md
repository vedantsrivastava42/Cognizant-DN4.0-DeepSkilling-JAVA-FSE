## **Exercise 2: E-commerce Platform Search Function**

**Scenario:** 

You are working on the search functionality of an e-commerce platform. The search needs to be optimized for fast performance.

**Steps:**

1. **Understand Asymptotic Notation:**

	- Explain Big O notation and how it helps in analyzing algorithms.
	- Describe the best, average, and worst-case scenarios for search operations.

2. **Setup:**

	- Create a class **Product** with attributes for searching, such as **productId, productName**, and **category**.

3. **Implementation:**
	- Implement linear search and binary search algorithms.
	- Store products in an array for linear search and a sorted array for binary search.

4. **Analysis:**
	- Compare the time complexity of linear and binary search algorithms.
	- Discuss which algorithm is more suitable for your platform and why.

## **Exercise 7: Financial Forecasting**

**Scenario:** 

You are developing a financial forecasting tool that predicts future values based on past data.

**Steps:**

1. **Understand Recursive Algorithms:**
	- Explain the concept of recursion and how it can simplify certain problems.

2. **Setup:**
	- Create a method to calculate the future value using a recursive approach.

3. **Implementation:**
	- Implement a recursive algorithm to predict future values based on past growth rates.

4. **Analysis:**
	- Discuss the time complexity of your recursive algorithm.
	- Explain how to optimize the recursive solution to avoid excessive computation.
